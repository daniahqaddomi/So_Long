# SO Long

**SO Long** is a simple 2D game written in **C** . The game involves navigating a player through a map while collecting items or avoiding walls.

## What I Did
- Created a 2D map with various elements (walls, player, collectibles).
- Implemented player movement using keyboard input.
- Used simple graphics with images to represent game elements.
- Ensured proper memory management and game logic.

## Usage
```sh
make       # To compile the game
./so_long  # To run the game
make clean # To remove compiled files
